# KevEng
A game engine developed in the name of Kevdog. Made in Python 3 with pygame.

This is an engine created by amateurs, for some guy named Kevin.

This engine will have documentation Kevin can hopefully understand and use as an advantage, and I'm contemplating whether to use an editor with GUI or not. For now
I will simply make it a window draw type thing, but you can manage scene objects and make them active or whatever. I don't know.

This is also a cool way for me to gain experience in software development, tool development, game development shit like that. Oh and if any of my friends want to help
they can parctipate too.

There will be a docs page using HTML, but it will be local. Maybe I'll add a search option, but I'm getting way too ahead of myself for now.

# Structure
For now, everything is in one folder. So when importing the module it'll be like
import keveng.submodule as wtv

In the future, I will have to start going up parent folders to access other submodules with each other (like inheriting structures from other
submodules that aren't in the same subfolder or is a parent folder)

tl;dr: everything is structured like ass rn, when there is more it will be set up more complicated but more organized
tl;dr tldr: lazy ass
