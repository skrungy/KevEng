# Editor
This will be the editor for keveng, because pickling (or compiling) objects and scenes won't be easy for kevin. My plans are to make it a 
GUI type thing. You can load scenes (scene_name#.dat) into the editor. I imagine it will run the app.setup call but freeze it while editing.
I don't know, I am 99% sure I am going over and out on this engine trying to make it like Unity.
